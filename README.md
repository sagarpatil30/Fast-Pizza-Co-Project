Introduction
Welcome to Fast Pizza Co., a React-based project that showcases my learning journey through fundamental React concepts. This basic project helped me grasp essential techniques for building dynamic and reusable UI components. Below is a brief overview of the concepts I have learned and implemented in this project.

Concepts Implemented
1. Components
In React, components are the building blocks of the user interface. This project demonstrates the creation of reusable components to maintain a clean and modular code structure. Components enhance reusability and separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to manage and scale.

2. Props
Props (properties) are used to pass data from parent components to child components. This project showcases the efficient use of props to share data between components, ensuring a dynamic and responsive UI.

3. JSX (JavaScript XML)
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It allows us to write HTML structures in the same file as JavaScript code. This project leverages JSX to define the structure of the components, making the code more readable and maintainable.

4. Rendering Lists
Rendering lists is a common task in React applications, often required when displaying data from APIs or databases. This project demonstrates the use of the map function to render lists from JSON data efficiently.

5. Conditional Rendering
Conditional rendering in React allows you to render different components or elements based on certain conditions. This project uses various techniques for conditional rendering, including logical &&, ternary operators, and if-else statements, to handle different UI states gracefully.

Project Overview
Fast Pizza Co. is a simple web application where users can view a list of pizzas, each with an image, description, and availability status. The application demonstrates the above React concepts through the following features:
